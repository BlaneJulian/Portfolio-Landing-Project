# Portfolio-Landing-Project
###This is my first time creating a Markdown.It does not look so bad so far.I can't wait to see what this looks like.

### This Markdown is supposed to be about yours truly... ME.
### I'm writing this in Atom. Only I don't see my Markdown in the web browser. Perhaps I'm not supposed to. Maybe it will be in git-hub.
### I share in my first code-review about my interests in programming. If you will notice that I like drones. That is why I chose the image.
### I'm looking to learn and improve both scripting and non-scripting languages. I want to be eligible for the site codewars.
